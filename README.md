# NftMetadataIndexerAPI

## Description

A smart contract suite implementing fractionalized NFT ownership and dynamic rarity scoring based on on-chain attribute interactions, leveraging Merkle tree proofs for efficient claim management and reduced gas costs during distribution.

## Features

- Indexes NFT metadata from multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana.
- Supports filtering NFT metadata based on specific attributes defined in the ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards.
- Stores indexed NFT metadata in a highly scalable and performant NoSQL database, such as Cassandra or MongoDB.
- Provides a REST API endpoint for querying NFT metadata using pagination and sorting.
- Implements a caching layer using Redis to minimize database load and improve API response times.
- Employs a robust event listener system to detect new NFT mints and transfers on supported blockchains.
- Utilizes parallel processing techniques to efficiently index large volumes of NFT metadata.
- Offers configurable rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure API stability.
